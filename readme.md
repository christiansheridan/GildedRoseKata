# Clean Code

### **Objective:**
* To learn to read code and write test for the `Inventory` class
* To refactor (aka clean up) the code in the `Inventory` class to make it more maintainable and readable

### **Purpose:**
* To understand why writing readable code matter

### **Instructions:**

1. Fork this Repository
    * [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your personal github account
    * [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) **your** `forked` repository to your local machine.
    * clean up the code in the `Inventory` class
    * commit your changes
    * submit a `pull request` which compares Zipcoder `master` to your `master`.
3. DO NOT CHANGE THE ITEM CLASS

### See test coverage
1. Right click on the `java` folder in the `test` directory
2. Select `Run all with test coverage`
3. Note a window pop up which display which line is covered

# Part 1 - Add tests
Add test to cover the code 100%.

DO NOT alter the Item class or Items property.

## Part 2 - Refactor the code

Note how hard it is to read this code. Your task is to refactor the code to make it more readable. First create a new branch called `refactor`.



## Part 3 - Add a new item

We have recently signed a supplier of conjured items. This requires an update to our system. First create a new branch called `new-item`. Add a `conjured` item.

- "Conjured" items degrade in Quality twice as fast as normal items

Feel free to make any changes to the UpdateQuality method and add any
new code as long as everything still works correctly.
